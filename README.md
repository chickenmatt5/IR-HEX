IR-HEX
=============

Infinite Recursion returns! Back and ready for Generation 6, IR-HEX has a purpose distinctly different from the IR-GTS of old. Gone are the easy-to-spoof Global Trade Station servers, but there's still binary Pokemon files to analyze, and infinity won't recurse itself!

## Functions
IR-HEX is an analysis tool for .pk6 files, the format that holds individual Pokemon data in gen 6, for programs like PKHeX. IR-HEX has a number of features not present in PKHeX, such as
* Infinite recursion!
* Rudimentary math-based legit checks
* Displaying more obscure data, like OT vs. non-OT happiness levels

Ultimately, this is a side project; it isn't trying to outdo any other program (namely due to the lack of a GUI). And besides, everyone knows a command line interface is waaay cooler.
